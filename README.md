# Card-Deck
A simple web page that displays a 3 card deck of two football players: Ronaldo, Messi, and the two of them together labeled "GOATs". Each card displays an image of the player, their name, and a brief description.

The cards are designed to be clickable and animated, with the "active" card being drawn out of the deck and displayed on top of the others. When a card is clicked, it moves to the top of the deck, becoming the active card and triggering an animation that moves the card out of the deck and into view. The other cards remain in the deck, and their position is adjusted to fill the space left by the drawn-out card.

The page's background color is set to #000b21, and the font used throughout the page is a sans-serif font. The cards themselves have a black background (#060a1f), a yellow border (#c9aa71), and a shadow effect that mimics the appearance of a real card. The deck is positioned in the center of the page and includes a "thickness" element that adds depth and realism to the deck.
